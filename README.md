# Optimizing Medication Inventory Management

## Project Overview
This project was completed as our Capstone Project for the Master of Applied Data Science program at the University of Michigan. 
Our project aims to optimize medication inventory management by leveraging historical data from the University of Michigan Medicine Pharmacy Administration to predict pharmaceutical demand. Our project’s goal is to reduce medication waste that would help lower costs and ensure that patients have access to the medications they need when they need them.

## Data Source
The primary data source is the “Medication Inventory Management Dataset” shared by the Pharmacy Manager of U-M: Michigan Medicine - Pharmacy Administration. The dataset contains historical medication inventory and transaction data, covering 3 hospitals, 40 outpatient locations, and over 120 clinics from February 2022 to June 2024. It includes detailed information on inventory levels, transactions (picks, restocks, wastes, etc.), medication details, locations and so on.
