With this in mind, we opted to use the 5th percentile instead of the 0th percentile (i.e., the absolute minimum) to ensure we did not underestimate the true inventory minimum.\n","\n","Similarly, we chose to use the 95th percentile of first_count_of_day values to estimate the maximum inventory level.
